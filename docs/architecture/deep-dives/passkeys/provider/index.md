# Bitwarden as a Passkey Provider (PP)

Bitwarden can act as a Passkey Provider (PP) to generate and store passkeys for other applications.
These can stored in either your personal vault or in an organization vault, just like regular
passwords. This means Bitwarden supports sharing passkeys with other users in your organization by
default.
