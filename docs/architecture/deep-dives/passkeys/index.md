# FIDO2 and Passkeys

This section contains deep dives into the FIDO2 standard and its architecture, as well as how
Bitwarden implements FIDO2.

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to FIDO2, but rather a summary of the most important
aspects of the standard, to be able to work with it in the context of Bitwarden.
