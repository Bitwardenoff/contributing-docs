# Credentials

This document provides an in-depth look at the FIDO2 credential, which is the technical term used to
refer to a passkey in the context of the FIDO2 standard. In this document they will be referred to
as simply "credentials".

## What is a Credential?

Technically the term "credential" refers to the public/private key pair that is generated by a FIDO2
authenticator. The private key is protected by the authenticator, and the public key is stored
server-side by the Relaying Party. The authenticator uses the private key to sign challenges from a
RP, and the RP uses the public key to verify the signature.

In this document the term "credential" will be used to refer the data structure that is protected by
the authenticator, including the private key, and any metadata that is associated with it.

## Data structure

### Required fields

Credentials are relatively simple data structures and only require the following fields:

- `credentialId` - Binary data sequence that uniquely identifies the credential. This field is
  attested and shared with the RP during the creation ceremony, and communicated during subsequent
  assertions.
- `rpId` - The identifier of the RP for which the credential was created. By default assigned the
  effective domain of the applications origin (ex: bitwarden.com).
- `privateKey` - Private key material, created during the creation ceremony.

### Notable optional fields

- `userHandle` - Binary data sequence that uniquely identifies the user account. This data is opaque
  for anyone other than the RP. It is used to associate a credential with a specific user account.
