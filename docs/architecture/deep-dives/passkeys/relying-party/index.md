# Bitwarden as a Relying Party (RP)

Bitwarden can act as a Relying Party (RP) for passkeys. This means that you can log in to Bitwarden
using a passkey. Bitwarden supports passkeys as a second factor of authentication (2FA) and as a
primary factor of authentication. When used as a primary factor of authentication, Bitwarden will
not require you to enter a username or password when logging in. In cases where your passkey does
not support encryption, Bitwarden will prompt you to enter a password to unlock your vault.
