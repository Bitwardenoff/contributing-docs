# Push Notifications

Bitwarden uses push notifications to communicate in real-time from the Bitwarden server to its
clients.

## Uses at Bitwarden

Currently, this functionality is used for:

- Syncing the vault between clients
- Bitwarden Send
- Passwordless login requests

## Technology in Use

The technology used to send and receive push notifications depends on the client involved.

The first key to understanding the push notification architecture at Bitwarden is that _all_ push
notifications are initiated from the Bitwarden server. It is the responsibility of the Bitwarden
server-side code to trigger push notifications when data is updated in such a way that a push
notification is required.

The way that the server communicates to the client depends upon the client involved.

For our mobile applications, we use Azure Notification Hub, which abstracts the Push Notification
Services (PNSs) for the Apple and Android ecosystems.

For the other clients, we use SignalR, which uses WebSockets (or other protocols) to establish
real-time client communications with our non-mobile clients.
