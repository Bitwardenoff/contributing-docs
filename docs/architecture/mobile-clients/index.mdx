# Mobile Clients Architecture

The mobile clients are Android, iOS with its extensions and watchOS. They all are located in this
[Git repository](https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile).

Principal structure is a follows:

- `Core`: Shared code that focus on the logical part of the app. Several classes are a port from the
  Web Clients to C#.
- `App`: Shared code that focus on the presentation layer of the app and some business logic as
  well.
- `Android`: All the code specific to the Android platform
- `iOS`: All the code speicific to the iOS platform
- `iOS.Core`: Shared code used by the iOS app and its extensions
- `iOS.Autofill`: iOS extension that handles Autofill
- `iOS.Extensions`: iOS extension that handles Autofill from the bottom sheet extension
- `iOS.ShareExtension`: iOS extension that handles sharing files through Send
- `watchOS`: All the code specific to the watchOS platform
  - `bitwarden`: Stub iOS app so that the watchOS app has a companion app on XCode
  - `bitwarden WatchKit App`: Main Watch app where we set assets.
  - `bitwarden WatchKit Extension`: All the logic and presentation logic for the Watch app is here
