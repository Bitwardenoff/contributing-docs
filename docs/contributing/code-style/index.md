# Code Style

This section contains general Code Style guidelines for the Bitwarden codebase. It is recommended to
read this section thoroughly as it contains many good advices for avoiding common pitfalls.

## General

### Lists

- Include trailing commas for multi-line lists when supported by the language. Inline lists do not
  have to follow this standard.

### Code Regions

- We do not use code regions in the codebase. If you find yourself needing to use a code region,
  consider refactoring the code to be more readable.
