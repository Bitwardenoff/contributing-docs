# Evolutionary Database Design

At Bitwarden we follow
[Evolutionary Database Design (EDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_database_design).
EDD describes a process where the database schema is continuously updated while still ensuring
compatibility with older releases by using database transition phases.

In short the Database Schema for the Bitwarden Server **must** support the previous release of the
server. The database migrations will be performed before the code deployment, and in the event of a
release rollback the database schema will **not** be updated.

For background on this decision please see the [Evolutionary Database Design RFD][edd-rfd].

## Design

### Nullable

Database tables, views and stored procedures should almost always use either nullable fields or have
a default value. Since this will allow stored procedures to omit columns, which is a requirement
when running both old and new code.

### EDD Process

The EDD breaks up each database migration into three phases. _Start_, _Transition_ and _End_.

![Refactoring Stages](./stages_refactoring.jpg)
[https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html#TransitionPhase](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html#TransitionPhase)

This necessitates two different database migrations. The first migration adds new content and is
backwards compatible with the existing code. The second migration removes content and is not
backwards compatible with that same code prior to the first migration.

### Example

Let’s look at an example, the rename column refactor is shown in the image below.

![Rename Column Refactor](./rename-column.gif)

In this refactor we rename the column `Fname` in the `Customer` table to `FirstName`. This could
easily be achieved using a regular `Alter Table` statement but that would break compatibility with
existing running code. Instead let's look at how we can incrementally refactor this table.

We will begin by creating a migration which adds the column `FirstName` to the `Customer` Table. At
the same time we will also update the Stored Procedures to sync the content between `FName` and
`FirstName` which ensures both the old and new server releases can run at the same time. The sync
code is highlighted in the code snippet below.

Afterwards the new server version will be deployed, once everything checks out the existing data
will be migrated using a _Data Migration_ script. Which essentially copies the `FName` to
`FirstName` columns.

Lastly the _Second Migration_ will be run which removes the old column and updates the Stored
Procedure to remove the synchronization logic.

#### Migrations

:::note

All database migrations should support being run multiple times; even if subsequent runs perform no
actions.

## Workflow

The Bitwarden specific workflow for writing migrations are described below.

### Developer

The development flow is described in [Migrations](./).

### Devops

#### On `rc` cut

Create a PR moving the future scripts.

- `DbScripts_future` to `DbScripts`, prefix the script with the current date, but retain the
  existing date.
- `dbo_future` to `dbo`.

#### After server release

1. Run whatever data migration scripts might be needed. (This might need to be batched and executed
   until all the data has been migrated)
2. After having the server run for a while execute the future migration script to clean up the
   database.

## Rollbacks

In the event the server release failed and needs to be rolled back, it should be as simple as just
re-deploying the previous version again. The database will **stay** in the transition phase until a
hotfix can be released, and the server can be updated.

The goal is to resolve the issue quickly and re-deploy the fixed code to minimize the time the
database stays in the transition phase. Should a feature need to be completely pulled, a new
migration needs to be written to undo the database changes and the future migration will also need
to be updated to work with the database changes. This is generally not recommended since pending
migrations (for other releases) will need to be revisited.

## Testing

Prior to merging a PR please ensure that the database changes run well on the currently released
version. We currently do not have an automated test suite for this and it’s up to the developers to
ensure their database changes run correctly against the currently released version.
