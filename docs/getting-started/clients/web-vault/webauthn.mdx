# WebAuthn

:::info

This page contains additional setup instructions if you need to test WebAuthn authentication
locally.

:::

The [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/) spec requires that a valid domain name is used. Since
`localhost` does not satisfy this requirement, you need to configure your local instance to use a
domain name.

There are multiple ways of doing this. However, the simplest method is to modify the operating
system's host file with a loopback to `127.0.0.1`.

## Configuration

Webpack protects against DNS rebind attacks by blocking hostnames by default. However, we can
specify specific hostnames to be allowed in the web environment configuration JSON files.

1. Create a `local.json` file in the `web/config/` folder
2. Add "bitwarden.test" as an `allowedHosts` entry:

   ```json
   {
     "dev": {
       "allowedHosts": ["bitwarden.test"]
     }
   }
   ```

:::note

If you are running the app, you must restart it for the config change to take effect.

### Hosts file

:::note

You will need administrator access to edit this file.

:::

The location of the host file differs slightly between operating systems.

<Tabs groupId="os">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{`C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{`/etc/hosts`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Open the file with the text editor of your choice. And append the following line.

```plain
127.0.0.1 bitwarden.test
```

### User Secrets

In addition to modifying the host file, the [user secret](../../server/user-secrets.md)
`globalSettings:baseServiceUri:vault` for API and Identity projects in the server needs to be
created or updated to reflect the domain name. For example:

```json
{
  ...
   "globalSettings":{
      "baseServiceUri":{
         "vault":"https://bitwarden.test:8080"
      }
   },
   ...
}
```

### Testing

You should now be ready to test WebAuthn on your local instance by going to
[https://bitwarden.test:8080](https://bitwarden.test:8080).
