## Configure Git blame

We recommend that you configure git to ignore the Prettier revision:

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

## Android Development

See the [Android Mobile app](./android/index.md) page to set up an Android development environment.

Unfortunately, iOS development requires provisioning profiles and other capabilities only available
to internal team members. We do not have any documentation for community developers at this time.
