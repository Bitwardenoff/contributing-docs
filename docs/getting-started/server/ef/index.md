# Entity Framework

:::warning

Entity Framework support is still in beta and is not suitable for production databases.

:::

## Background

Entity Framework (EF) is an ORM framework that acts as a wrapper around a database. It allows us to
support multiple (non-MSSQL) databases without having to maintain migration and query scripts for
each.

Our EF implementations currently support Postgres and mySQL.

## Setting up EF databases

The workflow here is broadly the same as with the normal MSSQL implementation: set up the docker
container, configure user secrets, and run the scripts in the `scripts` folders against their
relating databases in chronological order.

### Requirements

- A working local development server
- Docker
- A way to manage user secrets in the server project - see
  [User Secrets Reference](../user-secrets.md)
- Database management software (e.g. pgAdmin4 for Postgres or DBeaver for mySQL)
- The `dotnet` cli
- The `dotnet` cli [Entity Framework Core tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)

You can have multiple databases configured and switch between them by changing the value of the
`globalSettings:databaseProvider` user secret. You donâ€™t have to delete your connection strings.

### Postgres

1.  In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile postgres up
    ```

2.  Add the following values to your API and Identity user secrets, changing information like root
    password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make sure you update the existing values
    instead of creating new ones:

    ```json
    "globalSettings:databaseProvider": "postgres",
    "globalSettings:postgreSql:connectionString": "Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=example;Database=vault_dev;Include Error Detail=true",
    ```

3.  In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration:

    ```bash
    pwsh migrate.ps1 -postgres
    ```

4.  Optional: to verify that everything worked correctly:

    - Check the database tables to make sure everything has been created
    - Run the integration tests from the root of your server project using `dotnet test`. Note: this
      requires a configured MSSQL database. You may also need to also set up a MySql database for
      the tests to pass

### MySql

If you are using an M1 machine, you need to add `platform: linux/amd64` tag to the mysql service on
the docker-compose.yml file.

1.  In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile mysql up
    ```

2.  Add the following values to your API and Identity user secrets, changing information like root
    password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make sure you update the existing values
    instead of creating new ones:

    ```json
    "globalSettings:databaseProvider": "mysql",
    "globalSettings:mySql:connectionString": "server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=example;database=vault_dev",
    ```

3.  In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration:

    ```bash
    pwsh migrate.ps1 -mysql
    ```

    :::note

    `pwsh migrate.ps1 -all` will run migrations for all database providers

    :::

4.  Optional: to verify that everything worked correctly:

    - Check the database tables to make sure everything has been created
    - Run the integration tests from the root of your server project using `dotnet test`. Note: this
      requires a configured MSSQL database. You may also need to also set up a Postgres database for
      the tests to pass

## Generating EF Migrations

If you alter the database schema, you must create an EF migration script to ensure that EF databases
keep pace with these changes. Developers must do this and include the migrations with their PR.

### Instructions

1.  Update your data model in `Core/Entities` as desired
2.  Ensure your user secrets in `API` have the correct provider configured in the `databaseProvider`
    field. The value should match the provider you are generating migrations for.
3.  Open a terminal in the root of the project you want to generate a migration for (either
    `util/PostgresMigrations` or `util/MySqlMigrations`)
4.  Generate the migration. This should have the same name as the corresponding MSSQL migration
    (except for the date, which the the tool will prepend automatically):

    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations add [NAME_OF_MIGRATION]
    ```

5.  Generate the migration SQL script:

    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations script [LATEST_PREVIOUS_MIGRATION]
    ```

6.  Run the SQL script against your database
7.  Save the script output in the `Scripts` folder
