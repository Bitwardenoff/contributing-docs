# Cloudflare Tunnel

Sometimes it can be beneficial to allow other team members access to your locally running Bitwarden
instance. Usually this involves opening ports in firewalls, and even then you can usually only
connect through the IP address.

An alternative method which provides a few benefits are to use
[Cloudflare Argo Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/). Which works by setting up a
local tunnel between Cloudflare and your local machine, which provides access to a locally running
service. The tunnel can additionally be placed behind a cloudflare proxy which provides a valid SSL
certificate, making it perfect for testing with the mobile applications.

## Set up

1.  Install `cloudflared`, instructions are available at
    <https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation>.
2.  Start you local web server and take note of the `$PORT` it is running on
3.  Start the tunnel using `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:$PORT`

Cloudflare will build you a tunnel and provide the url to it: `*.trycloudflare.com`. Wait for the
DNS to start resolving before trying to access it.

**Note**, anyone with this URL can access the forwarded URL on your machine.

## Configure Web

To avoid certificate errors the web project needs to be configured to not use `https` and instead
serve itâ€™s content unencrypted and allow cloudflare to encrypt it after the tunnel.

Open `webpack.config.js` and comment out the following lines from `const devServer = {`

```ts
https: {
  key: fs.readFileSync('dev-server' + certSuffix + '.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('dev-server' + certSuffix + '.pem'),
},
```

And add the domain to `allowedHosts` in `local.json`:

```json
{
  "allowedHosts": ["<super-secret-tunnel>"]
}
```
